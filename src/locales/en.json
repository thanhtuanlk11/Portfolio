      "solution": "I implemented a retry mechanism with exponential backoff and created a queue system using .NET Core Background Services. I also added caching for frequently accessed partner data and implemented circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures. Collaborated with the team lead to design the architecture and received code review feedback.",

      "solution": "I optimized database queries by adding proper indexes on location fields and implemented pagination. Created a geospatial search using PostgreSQL PostGIS extension for efficient location-based queries. Used Entity Framework's spatial data types and worked with the senior developer to review the query optimization approach.",
      "outcome": "Delivered tracking workflows and admin tools for continuous updates. Dashboard load time reduced from 5+ seconds to under 1 second, supporting 10,000+ tree records.",

      "solution": "I implemented a state management solution using React Context and localStorage to persist order data across redirects. Created a payment status polling mechanism to check transaction completion when direct callbacks failed. Worked with the backend team to design a webhook-based fallback system and tested various redirect scenarios in Zalo's environment.",
